# Data

**Cooling Centers in LA County (2019)**

* Data includes cooling center addresses from LA County and City of LA websites for cooling centers, LA city recreation centers, and LA city year-round pools (2019 data). I plan to use this data set to map the existing cooling centers as a benchmark for new potential centers.

**LOCA daily maximum temperature CMCC-CMS RCP 8.5**
**LOCA yearly average maximum temperature CMCC-CMS RCP 8.5**

* The CMCC model is used by the IPCC 5th assessment model to see the projections in scenario for monthly, seasonal and yearly temperature (maximum and minimum). The data includes California data using the RCP 8.5 greenhouse gas concentration trajectory at its worst case scenario.
